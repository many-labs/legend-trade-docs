## Setting up the bot

Open the bot and run `/start` to begin. Next, add it to a group chat with your friends to get started.

<Note>
If you are new to the bot, adding it to a group lets everyone use commands in the same chat.
</Note>

## Depositing

Use the deposit flow in the bot to fund your account. Follow the prompts to generate a deposit address and confirm once funds arrive.

## Exploring tickers

Browse available tickers and view real‑time stats. Use the search inside the bot to find markets you care about.

## Opening your first position

Choose a ticker, select order type, size, and confirm. The bot will return a receipt with your fill details.

## Viewing your positions

Check open positions and PnL anytime from the portfolio section in the bot.
