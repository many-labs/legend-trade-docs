**The founding team has been trading crypto for over seven years.**

*We've went 1000x on our portoflios and have gone negative 95% multiple times.*

We are creating the platform for the millions of new traders that come to crypto to **learn, trade, and improve** with the best **low latency** execution and the **most amount of assets** possible.


## For beginners
∂
You’re new to trading or crypto and want a simple way to start with friends. 
You might have just made a Discord, a Telegram account, and an X profile. You're looking for people to follow, and don't know how to start.

- Clear onboarding inside Telegram — no new apps to learn
- Prove your skills in a fun, sociable way
- Quick access to prices, charts, and simple buys/sells
- As you rank up and trade against other people, make friends and create your core group of traders

## For grinders

You log in daily, you care about winning, and you want to level up.

- Daily matchups, leaderboards, and streaks to keep score
- Fast access to spot and perps with minimal friction
- Social context: trade where your group already is

## For creators and communities

You run a group, publish research, or curate calls and want tight feedback loops.

- Shared context inside Telegram: calls, entries, and results in one place
- Reputation via profiles, PnL, and stats
- Invitational loops and points to grow your community
- Interact with your community and increase engagement
- [stealth...]

Legend sits squarely in the latter: a place to trade, compete, and improve every day — with your friends — inside the chat app you already use.
